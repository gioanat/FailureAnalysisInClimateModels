2. Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package: To excute our code you need to download also
  - the Citation Style Language file "2d-materials.cls" from https://editor.citationstyles.org/styleInfo/?styleId=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zotero.org%2Fstyles%2F2d-materials, which is needed for generating the html version of our analysis;
  - the "DMwR_0.4.0.tar" R package from R archive https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/DMwR/.

## METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: The analysed dataset "pop_failures_V2_20210319" is a modified version of the relating dataset publicly available at link http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Climate+Model+Simulation+Crashes#. Our dataset is derived from the latter by deleting the integer number present in all the 14-th , 15-th and 16-th columns from row 362 (heading included) to the end.

2. Methods for processing the data: The aim of our research is to try to understand the relation between the probability of a simulation crash within the Parallel Ocean Program (POP2) component of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) and some of POP2 parameters. For this purpose, we will use some classification algorithms, namely Logistic Regression,  k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Support-Vector Machines (SVM), Kernel-SVM and Random Forest, applied to the dataset "pop_failures_V2_20210319". Furthermore, since this dataset is unbalanced, we will use some sampling methods that can allow us to re-balance the dataset, i.e. Random Oversampling, SMOTE and Relocating Safe-Level SMOTE. At the end, all the generated model are tested and the results show that ths SVM classifier performs the best, regardless of the kernel or the training set used to train it.

3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: The analysis is carried out on RStudio, which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. The R version used here is 4.0.0 with platform "x86_64-w64-mingw32". To execute code you need to install all packages listed in the "requirements.txt" file and the DMwR package that you must download from the R archive https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/DMwR/. Remember that some of the algorithms aformentioned use some random procedure. In order to make reproducible our experiment we have fix the seed. However, we have evidence that even if the seed is fixed, if you change platform or the R version, your results can be change. However, this fact should not change the overall results.

## DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR: [pop_failures_V2_20210319]
These dataset contains the ocean model perturbed parameters, which were selected by POP2 model developers. The dataset is provided at link http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Climate+Model+Simulation+Crashes# and its variable are explained in the reference article: "Lucas, D. D., Klein, R., Tannahill, J., Ivanova, D., Brandon, S., Domyancic, D., and Zhang, Y.: Failure analysis of parameter-induced simulation crashes in climate models, Geosci. Model Dev. Discuss., 6, 585-623, 2013.".

1. Number of variables: The number of columns is 21.

2. Number of cases/rows: The dataset has 540 rows, divided into 3 different ensemble studies, each of them containing 180 observations.

3. Variable List:

   - The integer variable "Study" indicate the ensable studies to which the instance belongs. It assumes one of the integer number among 1,2,3.
   - The integer variable "Run" is the row index. 
   - There are 18 POP2 parameters (real numbers), whose meanings and ranges are described both in our report and in the reference article.
   - The binary variable "outcome" of interest is equal to 1 if the row is relating to a successful simulation, 0 if the row is associated to a failure.

4. Missing data codes: The dataset does not contain Missing or NULL values.
